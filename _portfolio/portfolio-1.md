Having the ability to integrate with SMSC servers directly from your own platform has many advantages, but unfortunately it is not always trivial job and in some places it is not available and/or the SMSC access can prove to be very expensive. As such, it's important to have an alternative method for enabling two-way SMS messaging.

The "Mensageiro" App for the Mensageiro Platform, does just that by using an inexpensive Android phone. Since Android phones are essentially little computers with redundant network and power, it makes it easy for us to leverage it's GSM modem for our needs.
